## Fork the workshop repo, launch Codespaces

Link üëâüèΩ [Workshop repo](https://github.com/boxboat/iac-azure-workshop)

The destination should be a Codespaces enabled Org. You should prepend the repo name with your username, so if your username is fgauna, your repo should be `fgauna-iac-azure-workshop`.

Now that you have a repo to work from, let's launch Codespaces. Click the green **"Code"** button, **"Create codespaces on main"**. You can now choose to open that in the browser, or in your Visual Studio Code desktop app.

It can take a while, maybe 5 minutes. üòÖ

## More prep work, sorry!

Open a Terminal from the GitHub Codespace. It should be under **"Terminal"** then **"New Terminal"**. Use Bash, it should be the default.

Next, login to Azure. Ensure you have the right subscription selected.

``` bash
az login
```

Next, create a resource group and a storage account. We will use the storage account for the Terraform backend.
Substitue `[your-name]` with your first name to avoid name collisions with your peers.

``` bash
RESOURCE_GROUP_STATE="rg-workshop-[your-name]-state-001"
STORAGE_ACCOUNT_STATE="stwkshp[your-name]"
az group create -n $RESOURCE_GROUP_STATE -l eastus
az storage account create -n $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_STATE -g $RESOURCE_GROUP_STATE -l eastus
az storage container create -n workshop --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_STATE

export ARM_ACCESS_KEY=$(az storage account keys list -g $RESOURCE_GROUP_STATE -n $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_STATE --query "[0].value" -o tsv)
```

Now, from Visual Studio Code, open the `backend.tf` file. 

Set `storage_account_name` to the name of the storage account you created above.

``` yaml
# terraform/backend.tf
storage_account_name = "stwkshp[your-name]"
```

Now, you are ready to use some Terraform!

## Creating the virtual machine with Terraform

Before you run the Terraform configuration, you'll need to pick a password for your virtual machine.

``` bash
export TF_VAR_admin_password="<your password here>"
```

Next, you need to "initialize" Terraform. This will also validate that you can use the Terraform backend appropiately. 

``` bash
cd terraform
terraform init
```

Next, we do the Terraform "plan". A "plan" shows you what Terraform will do. 

``` bash
terraform plan
```
The output would look something like this.

![](/doks-theme/assets/images/codespaces-terraform-plan.png)

If everything looks good, then you can "apply." An "apply" is a way for you to tell Terraform to proceed with the "plan" and create/modify/delete the resources. The `-auto-approve` flag means that you give consent to Terraform to proceed without asking you again.

``` bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

You will see the Public IP for your virtual machine as an output. 
If you don't see the Public IP in your terminal, then you can run:

``` bash
terraform output public_ip
```

Don't worry, there's an Network Security Group (NSG) rule that only allows traffic from your public IP address.

## Configuring the virtual machine with Ansible

Configure your `inventory` file to use the Public IP from your virtual machine üëÜüèΩ. 

``` ini
# ansible/inventory.yaml
[domain_controllers]
vm-workshop ansible_host=<your ip goes here>
```

Next, execute the Ansible. But, first you'll have to set your current directory to the `ansible` directory.

``` bash
cd ..
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory --extra-vars="ansible_user=adminuser" --extra-vars="ansible_password=$TF_VAR_admin_password" playbook.yaml 
```

That's it! üéâ

You created a virtual machine using Terraform, then used Ansible to configure the virtual machine. 

## Clean Up üßπ

Now to deprovision everything, just use Terraform.

``` bash
cd ..
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```
